### Destructors:



1. Executed before the object is goes for garbage collection.
2. We can use destructors to dispose the resources like objects, files or any other devices or any other database system
3. In java we can create a destructor by using a method name called **finalize();**
4. finalize method cannot be overloaded.
5. Destructors will have return type, which is void.
6. We can also call the destructors explicitly.
7. To remove the object there is a thread called garbage collect or **demon thread**.

3. long-> Long
4. double-> Double
5. byte-> Byte
6. char-> Character



**Need of Wrapper classes?**

Helps in conversion from one datatype to another(type conversion)
